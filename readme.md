**Description:**
This repository contains works done on the prinCad project for the Object Oriented
Programming class of Principia College, Spring 2021 (CSCI 240). the goal was to 
make an application using *JavaFX11* which is really just a light paint like app
with buttons that give shapes options and a couple other buttons that allow control
of the application state like saving and opening old files.
